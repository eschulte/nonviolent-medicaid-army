-   Make visible a collective expression of anger and outrage at the
    state violence on a mass scale represented by the over 150k deaths
    and counting from COVID19, which are disproportionately impacting
    poor and dispossessed people, unhoused people, low-wage and
    essential workers, Black, Latinx and Indigenous people. The ruling
    class treats us as disposable while maintaining their profit as we
    are forced back to work and have austerity budgets, privatization
    and permanent elimination of jobs imposed upon us.

-   Call attention to the crisis that preceded COVID with 700 people
    dying every day in this country due to poverty. Put ourselves
    forward as the leading social force that has a program to address
    the prolonged crisis that we are in, drawing on and from the
    Jubilee policy platform of the PPC and using healthcare as a
    rallying point for our class.

-   Assist our organizations and fronts of struggle to build through
    the outreach and organizing that leads up to the Medicaid
    March(es).

-   Help the poor and dispossessed take action together across lines
    of geography and race, both within and across states and in
    particular strengthen the organized poor in the Poor Peopleâ€™s
    Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival

-   Pose a challenge to and indict the entire system, placing
    healthcare as a central fight in the broader struggle. Target
    profiteers and Wall St. while connecting the dots between all the
    issues faced by the Nonviolent Medicaid Army: healthcare, housing,
    wages, debt, clean air and water, criminalization, incarceration &
    detention, etc.

-   Unite with and help frame/shape whatever is spontaneously
    happening on the ground locally Proposal for the Marches:

-   Marches follow social distancing guidelines with masks and safety
    protocols

-   Building off of the experiences of the last several years in
    Vermont and PA, we propose a week of action for the week of
    September 28th in which we would do a series of actions over the
    course of the week based on what works for you (not all at the
    same date/time).

-   Each organization would decide on doing one or more marches
    depending on capacity, where chapters/committees are being built,
    etc.

-   For every place where a march is being held organizations pick one
    or more specific targets or areas of focus to highlight (examples:
    a closed hospital, the safety of teachers and students as the
    state re-opens schools, the need for Medicaid expansion, a
    healthcare profiteer, the fact that essential workers lack
    healthcare, the inability to stay safe from the pandemic while
    unhoused, dangerous working conditions, water shut-offs, the need
    to release people from detention/incarceration, etc.

-   A short march takes place (no more than .5 miles) ideally linking
    a site connected to state power (ie City Hall, the State House, a
    courthouse) to a site connected to capital (a fast food
    restaurant, hospital, etc.) however if that is not feasible,
    wherever people speak is ideally an important target.

-   All Medicaid Marches share a short set of talking points and
    common imagery related to the Nonviolent Medicaid Army which are
    then added to by the local organization and the specific context
    and situation being highlighted.

-   We develop and implement a coordinated media/social media
    strategy.
