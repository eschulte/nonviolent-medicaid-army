### What is the Nonviolent Medicaid Army?

The Nonviolent Medicaid Army of the poor is a growing militant force
of the poor and dispossessed, united across identities, regions, races
and issues, modeled after MLK’s ‘nonviolent army of the poor’ from
the first Poor People’s Campaign of 1968. We are currently active in 
states like Wyoming, Wisconsin, Texas, Indiana, Georgia, Kansas, 
Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland and Vermont. We are not a coalition 
or a campaign but a network of organizations and committees that 
understand healthcare to be a strategic front of struggle
to unite the working class. Find us on Facebook at

### What is the Nonviolent Medicaid Army Week of Action?

The 2023 Nonviolent Medicaid Army Week of Action will take place 
around the country between September 17-23, 2023. The Week of Action
will focus on the theme Medicaid Cuts = Death and call attention to 
the up to 24 million people who are losing their healthcare right now
as the result of a bipartisan decision that was included in the Omnibus 
spending bill of December 2022 and then signed by President Biden. Actions 
around the country will make the invisible visible and shift the 
narrative, calling for an end to Medicaid cuts. In the richest country
that has ever existed in the history of the world, we know there
is enough!

### Who makes up the Nonviolent Medicaid Army?

There are currently over 90 million people in the U.S. who get
their healthcare through Medicaid and CHIP (Children's Health
Insurance Program). Those who are on or excluded from Medicaid 
represent the diversity of the entire working class and are 
impacted by every single front of struggle there is - be it 
the fight for housing, a healthy environment, living wages, 
food, education, freedom from debt, freedom of migration, or 
freedom from criminalization and incarceration. The fight for 
Medicaid is common to the North and the South of the U.S. 
and the fight for healthcare broadly unites the global working class.


### Why the Nonviolent Medicaid Army?

As millions more in this country are thrown into the ranks of the
unemployed or underemployed, the need for Medicaid steadily increases
and healthcare will continue to be one of the top concerns
on the minds of the everyday people. We call for "Medicaid for All" - 
expanding Medicaid to every resident alongside the abolition of
Managed Care Organizations and de-commodification of the healthcare
system overall. The Nonviolent Medicaid Army centers the leading
social force - the poor and dispossessed - in the fight for healthcare
as a human right, a transformative demand in the context of a system
that seeks to profit off of our pain, sickness and death.


### Who can Join the Nonviolent Medicaid Army?

Any organization of the poor and dispossessed whose members are
directly impacted by the fight for healthcare as a human right or any
of the fronts of struggle faced by those who are on Medicaid or who
need it, can and should join the Nonviolent Medicaid Army. The
Nonviolent Medicaid Army is a vehicle through which we can cohere
leaders to assess the terrain and take strategic action together to
grow “the new and unsettling force” into an unstoppable nonviolent
army commensurate with the times we are living in.
