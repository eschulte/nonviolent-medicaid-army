<li>
<p>Make visible a collective expression of anger and outrage at the
state violence on a mass scale represented by the over 200,000
deaths and counting from COVID19, which are disproportionately
impacting poor and dispossessed people, unhoused people, low-wage
and essential workers, Black, Latinx and Indigenous people. The
ruling class treats us as disposable while maintaining their profit
as we are forced back to work and have austerity budgets,
privatization and permanent elimination of jobs imposed upon us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call attention to the crisis that preceded COVID with 700 people
dying every day in this country due to poverty. Put ourselves
forward as the leading social force that has a program to address
the prolonged crisis that we are in, drawing on and from the Jubilee
policy platform of the Poor Peopleâ€™s Campaign: A National Call for
Moral Revival.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieve a truly universal, single payer healthcare system.</p>
</li>
