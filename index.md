      Join us on Saturday, October 3rd for a socially-distanced march and rally demanding Governor Scott:

      1. Guarantee healthcare as a human right for all Vermont residents, regardless of income or immigration status.  2. Cut the state's contract with OneCare, an unaccountable for-profit company siphoning off millions in Medicaid funding that should be spent on people's healthcare.

      **Meet at 12pm at the Rockingham Health Center, 1 Hospital Court in Bellows Falls**

      This event is part of a national \"Medicaid March\" week of action organized by the Nonviolent Medicaid Army with events in Vermont, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Kansas. Our goal is to build the movement for healthcare and demand an end to state violence in all of its forms, including the 189k people -- disproportionately poor and people of color -- who have died from COVID19 at the hands of a government more committed to bailing out corporations than keeping people safe, and the 700 people who were dying every day in this country from poverty before the pandemic even started.

      Healthcare is a Human Right! Medicaid for All!

      We have to stay in the streets! Join Put People First! PA and partners for our statewide week of action: Medicaid Marches!

      The Philadelphia Medicaid March will be part of a statewide week of marches across PA and across the country with the Nonviolent Medicaid Army!

      The Philadelphia Medicaid March will begin at the old Inquirer Building at 400 N. Broad St. The city is spending $300 million to renovate the building for the new Police Headquarters. 

      We will end just down the street at the former Hahnemann Hospital that also sits empty. However in this case owner Joel Freedman is preparing to sell the building to a real estate developer to create high end condos. Mayor Kenney, Health Commissioner Thomas Farley and Governor Wolf have abdicated their responsibility - in the middle of a pandemic and global economic crisis - to re-open closed hospitals like Hahnemann and bring them under public control.

      UPMC got a billion dollar bailout to help fight Covid19, yet we are no closer to stopping the pandemic in Allegheny County and thousands of us are unemployed, uninsured, and behind on rent.

      We have to stay in the streets!

      Join Put People First! PA and partners for our statewide week of action: Medicaid Marches!

      The Northeast PA Medicaid March will be part of a statewide week of marches across PA and across the country with the Nonviolent Medicaid Army! 

      We were living amidst a crisis before the COVID-19 pandemic, with millions of Americans uninsured or underinsured, and hundreds dying from poverty-related causes each day. The pandemic has exacerbated this crisis, as staggering numbers of us face unemployment and uncertainty about the future. It doesn’t have to be this way! But in order to change it, we must organize across our differences and demand it!

      We march to raise up the story of Shaheen Mackey, who died in police custody during a medical emergency in Wilkes Barre. We march for all those who have been victims of state violence including the nearly 190,000 and counting dead from the coronavirus pandemic. 

      The Northeast PA Medicaid March will begin on Friday October 2nd at 3:30 pm at the Public Square in Wilkes Barre and then march to the Police Headquarters and end at the County Assistance Office.

      We have to stay in the streets!<br>Join Put People First! PA and partners for our statewide week of action: Medicaid Marches!

      The South Central PA Medicaid March will be part of a statewide week of marches across PA and across the country with the Nonviolent Medicaid Army!

      The South Central PA Medicaid March will begin in front of St. Joseph’s hospital at 250 College Ave, Lancaster, PA. UPMC received one of the largest Covid-19 relief packages, has $6 BILLION dollars in reserve, and recently wrote legislation that was passed nearly unanimously by our state legislature that will grant healthcare profiteers like UPMC & Penn Medicine LGH $500 MILLION of our tax dollars plus control over our nursing home facilities, based on regions, we are concerned about who will be in charge of the nursing home facilities in South Central PA given we have a significant elderly population in our region. 

      We will march around St. Joseph’s Hospital that currently sits empty, sharing information and powerful testimonies along the way. Despite having grounds to hold UPMC accountable for their actions and harm done to our communities, people in power are allowing them to sell the property to a real estate developer to create primarily luxury housing and boutiques while people are suffering and dying in Lancaster County Prison, sleeping on the streets, and facing homelessness. Pennsylvania state legislators, Mayor Sorace, Lancaster City Council (if they pass the rezoning petition), and Governor Wolf have abdicated their responsibility - in the middle of a pandemic and global economic crisis - to re-open closed hospitals like St. Joseph’s hospital and bring them under public control.
