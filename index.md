      Join us on Saturday, October 3rd for a socially-distanced march and rally demanding Governor Scott:

      1. Guarantee healthcare as a human right for all Vermont residents, regardless of income or immigration status.  2. Cut the state's contract with OneCare, an unaccountable for-profit company siphoning off millions in Medicaid funding that should be spent on people's healthcare.

      **Meet at 12pm at the Rockingham Health Center, 1 Hospital Court in Bellows Falls**

      This event is part of a national \"Medicaid March\" week of action organized by the Nonviolent Medicaid Army with events in Vermont, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Kansas. Our goal is to build the movement for healthcare and demand an end to state violence in all of its forms, including the 189k people -- disproportionately poor and people of color -- who have died from COVID19 at the hands of a government more committed to bailing out corporations than keeping people safe, and the 700 people who were dying every day in this country from poverty before the pandemic even started.

      Healthcare is a Human Right! Medicaid for All!

      The Philadelphia Medicaid March will be part of a statewide week of marches across PA and across the country with the Nonviolent Medicaid Army!

      The Philadelphia Medicaid March will begin at the old Inquirer Building at 400 N. Broad St. The city is spending $300 million to renovate the building for the new Police Headquarters. 

      We will end just down the street at the former Hahnemann Hospital that also sits empty. However in this case owner Joel Freedman is preparing to sell the building to a real estate developer to create high end condos. Mayor Kenney, Health Commissioner Thomas Farley and Governor Wolf have abdicated their responsibility - in the middle of a pandemic and global economic crisis - to re-open closed hospitals like Hahnemann and bring them under public control.

      The Northeast PA Medicaid March will be part of a statewide week of marches across PA and across the country with the Nonviolent Medicaid Army! 

      We were living amidst a crisis before the COVID-19 pandemic, with millions of Americans uninsured or underinsured, and hundreds dying from poverty-related causes each day. The pandemic has exacerbated this crisis, as staggering numbers of us face unemployment and uncertainty about the future. It doesn’t have to be this way! But in order to change it, we must organize across our differences and demand it!

      We march to raise up the story of Shaheen Mackey, who died in police custody during a medical emergency in Wilkes Barre. We march for all those who have been victims of state violence including the nearly 190,000 and counting dead from the coronavirus pandemic. 

      The Northeast PA Medicaid March will begin on Friday October 2nd at 3:30 pm at the Public Square in Wilkes Barre and then march to the Police Headquarters and end at the County Assistance Office.

      We have to stay in the streets!<br>Join Put People First! PA and partners for our statewide week of action: Medicaid Marches!

      The South Central PA Medicaid March will be part of a statewide week of marches across PA and across the country with the Nonviolent Medicaid Army!

      The South Central PA Medicaid March will begin in front of St. Joseph’s hospital at 250 College Ave, Lancaster, PA. UPMC received one of the largest Covid-19 relief packages, has $6 BILLION dollars in reserve, and recently wrote legislation that was passed nearly unanimously by our state legislature that will grant healthcare profiteers like UPMC & Penn Medicine LGH $500 MILLION of our tax dollars plus control over our nursing home facilities, based on regions, we are concerned about who will be in charge of the nursing home facilities in South Central PA given we have a significant elderly population in our region. 

      We will march around St. Joseph’s Hospital that currently sits empty, sharing information and powerful testimonies along the way. Despite having grounds to hold UPMC accountable for their actions and harm done to our communities, people in power are allowing them to sell the property to a real estate developer to create primarily luxury housing and boutiques while people are suffering and dying in Lancaster County Prison, sleeping on the streets, and facing homelessness. Pennsylvania state legislators, Mayor Sorace, Lancaster City Council (if they pass the rezoning petition), and Governor Wolf have abdicated their responsibility - in the middle of a pandemic and global economic crisis - to re-open closed hospitals like St. Joseph’s hospital and bring them under public control.

      NC Raise Up, North Carolina Poor People's Campaign, Fayetteville PACT, and Action NC are coming together to demand HEALTHCARE FOR ALL AND WORKER SAFETY! 

      From corporate CEOs to elected officials, our health and safety is being ignored on and off the job. Workers are the experts on the problems and the solutions of our lives. 

      We're fed up with lack of safety equipment and protections on the job. 

      We're fed up with healthcare only being available to a few in the wealthiest country in the world. 

      We're fed up with risking our lives for poverty wages-- hazardous work deserves hazard pay! 

      Access to healthcare and workplace safety issues are racial justice issues. Low wage workers are disproportionately Black and Brown people AND a disproportionate number of Black and Brown people do not have access to healthcare. 

      In solidarity with the Non-Violent Medicaid Army, workers and allies are taking action across the country the last week of September. 

      We are coming together to force CEOs and elected officials to value people's health over corporate profits. 

      WE DEMAND healthcare for all and a voice on the job setting health and safety standards. 

      Join us on Saturday, October 3rd at noon for the Medicaid March!

      Specific details for the march to be released soon!!

      Join Put People First! PA and partners for our statewide week of action: Medicaid Marches!
      Johnstown City Council has plans to increase the police department's budget by $250,000 and hire new officers, at a time when the city can barely balance its budget and despite the department's track record of violence. We don't need more cops! We need our city and state elected leaders to put our tax dollars into healthcare, housing, Covid19 testing, and other resources for poor and dispossessed people to get through this crisis! 

      We demand:
      *City Council: Cancel plans to increase the police budget and hire new officers. Put that money into forming a crisis response team of healthcare and social workers in situations where police are not needed.
      *Governor Wolf: Apply for a federal waiver to expand Medicaid to all PA residents in the midst of the pandemic and global economic depression in which 1.5 million people in PA are losing employer-based insurance.
      *PA Legislature: Create an Office of the Public Healthcare Advocate, a state office that fights for the healthcare rights of our people! Restore the adult dental benefit in Medicaid that was cut in 2011

      October 4th we hit the streets!

      The Wisconsin Poor People's Campaign is joining the Non-Violent Medicaid Army for a week of action to center poor and dispossessed people in the fight for healthcare as a human right! 

      We are facing a crisis *within* a crisis. While the system treats healthcare as a money-making scheme—not a fundamental human right—we continue to drown in hospital bills, getting sicker as a few get richer. This is particularly true during this pandemic, when more than 5 million people have lost their health insurance nationally. Wisconsin is no different: 
      - More than 100,000 COVID-19 infections and 1,300 fatalities
      - Three-feet tall piles of bills
      - More than 300,000 who have lost health insurance
      - Ever-growing anxiety, fatigue, and depression
      - College closures due to premature move-in plans
      - More than 100,000 eviction filings
      - Suffocating prisons trapping 21,000 people in with COVID-19 

      And so much more. Still worse, while we march against the murders of Black lives, our caste-like healthcare, housing, education, and carceral systems kill countless Black lives daily.

      Join us in connecting healthcare and the fight for housing, living wages, education, freedom of migration, and freedom from criminalization and incarceration. We’ll meet at the Capitol building to call on politicians who prioritize private profit over Wisconsinites’ well-being, and march to the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce Office to call on the corporations that benefit from our despair.

      We demand an end to state violence in all its forms. It is tragically wrong that nearly 200,000 people—disproportionately poor and people of color—have died from COVID-19 at the hands of a government more committed to bailing out corporations than keeping people safe, and it is tragically wrong that 700 people were dying every day from poverty before this pandemic. It is time to call out the system that profits off of our pain, our sickness, and our death. It is time to March for Medicaid. See you on October 4th.

      - Make visible a collective expression of anger and outrage at the state violence on a mass scale represented by the over 190k deaths and counting from COVID19, which are disproportionately impacting poor and dispossessed people, unhoused people, low-wage and essential workers, Black, Latinx and Indigenous people.

      - Reject being treated as disposable by the ruling class while they maintain their profit as we are forced back to work and have austerity budgets, privatization and permanent elimination of jobs imposed upon us.

      - Call attention to the crisis that preceded COVID with 700 people dying every day in this country due to poverty.

      - Take action together united across lines of division as the leading social force that has a program to address the prolonged crisis that we are in, drawing on and from the Jubilee policy platform of the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival and using healthcare as a rallying point for our class.
