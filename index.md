## Medicaid Mondays

Personal stories are powerful. The NVMA calls on folks to share their
stories as part of #MedicaidMondays, a critical tactic in our ongoing
Medicaid Cut-Offs Organizing Drive. When we share our own experience,
our own healthcare story, we break our isolation and we build our
movement!

And it’s easy to do!  Post a photo of yourself on social media holding
a sign, a piece of paper or a dry erase board with the hashtags
`#MedicaidCutsEqualsDeath`, `#NonviolentMedicaidArmy`,
`#OrganizeProtectExpandMedicaid`, and `#Medicaid4All`.  Include a few
sentences on the sign itself (Example 1) stating why protecting and
expanding Medicaid is important to you and your family or (Example 2)
include only the hashtag on the sign and put your story in the body of
the post.

Another option is to make a short video, no longer than a minute or
two, stating why protecting and expanding Medicaid is important to you
and post to social media with a short blurb and the same
hashtags. Examples are below.

Additionally, if it’s easier, you can complete [this
form](https://forms.gle/JsW4LCHouoEz2mZy5) to share your story with
us!

1. **Example 1**:

    ![Example 1]({{ "/img/woody-medicaid-monday.jpg"|url }})

    I just replaced one hip, I need the other done. It’s great to have
    Medicaid, but the only problem is when the insurance wanna take
    you through the ringer. It’s a shame when they know you’re needing
    help but hassle you for what you need. I need a cardiologist but
    it’s not easy to get them.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

2. **Example 2**:

    ![Example 2]({{ "/img/mm-example-2.png"|url }})

    My name is Tammy Rosing, and I live in Lancaster
    County. Protecting Medicaid and expanding it to all residents is
    important to me because we all deserve healthcare and I need to be
    able to continue to take my life sustaining medication and to keep
    being able to see my specialist doctors. No one should be cut off
    of healthcare in Pennsylvania or anywhere in the U.S.

## About

### What is the Nonviolent Medicaid Army?

The Nonviolent Medicaid Army of the poor is a growing, politically
independent force of the poor and dispossessed, united across
identities, regions, races and issues, modeled after MLK's 'nonviolent
army of the poor' from the first Poor People's Campaign of 1968. We
are currently active in states like Wyoming, Wisconsin, Texas,
Indiana, Georgia, Massachusetts, Illinois, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, Maryland and Vermont. We are not a
coalition or a campaign but a network of organizations and committees
that understand healthcare to be a strategic front of struggle to
unite the working class. Find us on Facebook at
<https://www.facebook.com/nonviolentmedicaidarmy>.

### What is the Nonviolent Medicaid Army Week of Action?

The 2024 Nonviolent Medicaid Army Week of Action will take place
around the country between September 21-28, 2024. The Week of Action
will focus on the theme Medicaid Cuts = Death and call attention to
more than 25 million people who have been cut from Medicaid since
April 1, 2023 as the result of a bipartisan decision that was included
in the Omnibus spending bill of December 2022 and then signed by
President Biden. Actions around the country will make the invisible
visible and shift the narrative, calling for an end to Medicaid cuts,
keeping our hospitals open, stopping the privatization of Medicaid,
Medicare, and the Veterans Administration and calling for Medicaid 4
All. In the richest country that has ever existed in the history of
the world, we know there is enough!

### Who makes up the Nonviolent Medicaid Army?

There are currently over 90 million people in the U.S. who get
their healthcare through Medicaid and CHIP (Children's Health
Insurance Program). Those who are on or excluded from Medicaid 
represent the diversity of the entire working class and are 
impacted by every single front of struggle there is - be it 
the fight for housing, a healthy environment, living wages, 
food, education, freedom from debt, freedom of migration, or 
freedom from criminalization and incarceration. The fight for 
Medicaid is common to the North and the South of the U.S. 
and the fight for healthcare broadly unites the global working class.


### Why the Nonviolent Medicaid Army?

As millions more in this country are thrown into the ranks of the
unemployed or underemployed, the need for Medicaid steadily increases
and healthcare will continue to be one of the top concerns
on the minds of the everyday people. We call for "Medicaid for All" - 
expanding Medicaid to every resident alongside the abolition of
Managed Care Organizations and de-commodification of the healthcare
system overall. The Nonviolent Medicaid Army centers the leading
social force - the poor and dispossessed - in the fight for healthcare
as a human right, a transformative demand in the context of a system
that seeks to profit off of our pain, sickness and death.


### Who can Join the Nonviolent Medicaid Army?

Any organization of the poor and dispossessed whose members are
directly impacted by the fight for healthcare as a human right or any
of the fronts of struggle faced by those who are on Medicaid or who
need it, can and should join the Nonviolent Medicaid Army. The
Nonviolent Medicaid Army is a vehicle through which we can cohere
leaders to assess the terrain and take strategic action together to
grow “the new and unsettling force” into an unstoppable nonviolent
army commensurate with the times we are living in.
