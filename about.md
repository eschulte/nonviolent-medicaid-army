We in the U.S. are at the start of a global pandemic combined with a
global depression. We are heading into an objectively revolutionary
period in terms of economic and social conditions. Current numbers
indicate that over 40 million, or 25% of the U.S. workforce has filed
for unemployment since the beginning of the pandemic. Over 5 million
people lost their healthcare coverage in the same period that 138,000
people and counting have been killed by the virus. The pandemic and
depression are layered upon a deeper and permanent crisis that has
already been afflicting our communities - with 140 million poor or
near poor in the U.S. A key role of cadre is to understand both the
potential and dangers of the coming period, and do everything in our
power to cohere, develop and build the unity of the poor and
dispossessed around our basic needs and human rights as we head into
this period of protracted crisis.
